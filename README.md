## Webtraffic recorder system

Whenever a user visits a system, an online data capture application system is formed. The goal was to record the details of the form using SQL and python. The data is recorded in a live version, meaning the data is deleted from the form if user wishes or undo, if the user wishes to make any change. All the data is stored anonymously respecting a user privacy. 

**Note:  server.py consists of python and SQL scripts for the application.**
